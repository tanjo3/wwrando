  # * Inside Hyrule Castle.

  | Hero's Bow
  | Hookshot
  # Skull Hammer technically works but it's extremely annoying to hit them with. Same with bombs.
Can Defeat Rats:
  Hero's Sword
  | Hero's Bow
  | Bombs
  | Boomerang
  | Skull Hammer
  | Grappling Hook
  # Hookshot pulls them towards you but doesn't appear to damage them. Actually, it seems Hookshot can rarely push them out of bounds.
  # Skull Hammer also stuns them if you hit the ground near them.

  | Hero's Bow
  | Boomerang
  | Skull Hammer
  | Grappling Hook
Can Cut Down Dexivines:
  Hero's Sword

  | Skull Hammer

  | Hookshot
Can Defeat Dexivines:
  Impossible
  # They never die forever, they come back the instant they're cut down.
  # Things that trigger when all enemies are dead will never trigger.
Can Defeat Freshwater Octoroks:
  Hero's Bow
  | Boomerang
  | Hookshot
  # The sword and shield can be used to reflect projectiles back at them to kill them, but this only works if the player is at the same horizontal level as the Octorok, otherwise it won't shoot projectiles in the first place.
  # Bombs can also kill them, but they only work in situations where you can actually throw a bomb far enough to reach them. Even then, the timing is very precise because the bomb will be defused when it hits the water.
Can Defeat Saltwater Octoroks:
  Hero's Bow
  | Boomerang
  | Hookshot
  # Bombs work when fired from KoRL's cannon, but if a Saltwater Octorok got placed somewhere not in the sea you couldn't use the cannon, and it's too hard to hit them by throwing bombs.
Can Defeat Beamos:
  Nothing
  # Beamos do not count as alive, and therefore not being able to kill them doesn't stop a room from thinking all enemies in the room are dead.
Can Defeat Gyorgs:
  Boomerang
  | Hero's Bow
  | Hookshot
Can Defeat Gunboats:
  Bombs

Can Defeat Gohma:
  Grappling Hook

Can Defeat Kalle Demos:
  Boomerang
  # No sword needed - Kalle Demos can be damaged with just boomerang.
Can Defeat Gohdan:
  (Hero's Bow | Hookshot)
  & Bombs
  # You can use hookshot to shoot all of Gohdan's eyes instead of the bow.
Can Defeat Helmaroc King:
  Skull Hammer
  # Doesn't require a sword or anything - just the hammer both breaks his mask and damages him.
Can Defeat Jalhalla:
  (Can Aim Mirror Shield | Light Arrows)
  & Power Bracelets
  & Can Defeat Jalhalla Poes
  # Light Arrows also work to materialize Jalhalla.
Can Defeat Molgera:
  Hookshot
  & (
    Hero's Sword
    | Hero's Bow
    | Boomerang
    | Grappling Hook
    | Skull Hammer
    | Bombs
  )
  # Bombs are tricky since you have to repeatedly use hookshot to keep the tongue in place while you wait for the bomb, or you have to aim the hookshot at the bomb to set it off instantly.

Can Destroy Cannons:
  Bombs
  | Boomerang
  # Two hits from the boomerang also destroys cannons.
Can Cut Down Outset Trees:
  Hero's Sword
  | Boomerang
  | Skull Hammer
  # Fire Arrows and Bombs don't work.
  # Luring a ChuChu up the hill and having it jump on the trees doesn't work.
  # Carrying the big pig to the trees and enraging it DOES work, it can cut the trees. But this is not currently in the logic because it's obscure and slow to do.
Can Cut Down Hanging DRC Platform:
  Hero's Sword
  | Bombs
  | Hero's Bow
  | Skull Hammer
  # Hookshot and Grappling Hook can also technically cut the ropes, but it's too precise to aim them.
  # Boomerang can't cut them at all.
Can Cut Grass:
  Hero's Sword
  | Skull Hammer
  | Boomerang
  | Bombs
Can Sword Fight with Orca:
  Hero's Sword
  | In Swordless Mode
  # Swordless gives you a sword temporarily while in Orca's house, so you don't need to have found a sword item.
